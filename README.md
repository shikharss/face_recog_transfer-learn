# face_recog_transfer-learn

In this small project, I have created a face recognition model using VGG16 model and concept of transfer learning.
For face recognition, I have used opencv module to capture the image.
I have created to seprate folders for test and train.
I have used VGG16 model to train and used transfer learning to avoid re-training of the existing weights.
